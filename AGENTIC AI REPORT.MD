## INTRODUCTION  
Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved significantly—from rule-based systems to advanced machine learning models capable of producing human-like output. However, many traditional AI systems like chatbots and recommendation engines operate reactively, providing responses based on user input without the ability to make independent decisions.  

**Agentic AI** marks a revolution in artificial intelligence. These systems can think, plan, and act autonomously, enabling them to achieve multifaceted goals. Unlike their predecessors, agentic systems are proactive, dynamic, and require minimal human oversight.

## WHAT IS AGENTIC AI?  
**Agentic AI** is an advanced form of artificial intelligence that acts independently to achieve its objectives. Derived from the word *agency*—meaning the ability to act and make decisions on one’s own—Agentic AI does not simply respond to instructions but proactively determines optimal paths to complete tasks efficiently.  

Agentic systems differ from traditional AI by being:  
- **Reasoning-capable:** They make decisions and learn from experiences.  
- **Autonomous:** They operate with or without human input.  
- **Adaptive:** They adjust their approach based on new data or changing environments.  

This makes Agentic AI ideal for complex tasks across industries such as healthcare, business, and scientific research.
