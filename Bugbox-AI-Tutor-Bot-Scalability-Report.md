# Scalability Overview for Bugbox AI Tutor Bot

## Deployment Cost with GPT-4o

Bugbox AI Tutor Bot uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model. Pricing for this model is as follows:

- **$2.50 per 1 million input tokens**
- **$10.00 per 1 million output tokens**

On average:

- 1 token â‰ˆ 4 characters in English
- A student might send around 20 messages per hour, each about 400 characters (~100 tokens)
- The AI's responses are typically ~1000 characters (~250 tokens)

### Cost Breakdown:

| Usage Type            | Per Student | 10 Students |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Input (2,000 tokens)  | $0.005     | $0.05      |
| Output (5,000 tokens) | $0.05      | $0.50      |
| **Total/hour**        | **$0.055** | **$0.55**  |

This makes it feasible to deploy in classrooms with minimal operational cost.

## Front-End Scalability

Bugbox Tutor Bot is built with **React.js** and **Vite**, which provides a lightweight and highly responsive interface. These platforms are designed for scalability and allow the Tutor Bot to perform efficiently across a wide range of devices, including ones commonly found within schools.

The Tutor Bot can also be hosted on a variety of platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages**. These services offer Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) which allow widespread deployment of the Tutor Bot regardless of distance to the main server.

Because the front-end is static, deploying the Tutor Bot to hundreds (or thousands) of users doesn't require manually provisioning servers. This is because it primarily involves front-end asset delivery, which is managed by the host platform.

## Back-End Options

Currently, Bugbox Tutor Bot operates with a serverless front-end that directly connects to the ChatGPT OpenAI API. This minimal approach is suitable for small-scale pilots or classrooms.

As user volume grows or if advanced features like user accounts, progress tracking, or custom reporting are needed, a back end could be introduced. Below are some options to tackle this:

### Serverless Functions

Platforms such as **AWS Lambda**, **Vercel Functions**, or **Google Cloud Functions** allow scalable, event-driven execution of backend tasks. They are cost-effective for workloads that scale unpredictably and simplify the deployment and maintenance required.

### Firebase / Supabase

These Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms offer integrated databases, authentication, storage, and real-time capabilities. Firebase and Supabase are ideal for quick development and provide easy to use dashboards for non-developers to manage content and users.

### Dedicated Node.js Server

For advanced integration needs (e.g. with school information systems or LMS platforms), a dedicated **Node.js** server can offer a high degree of control. This setup supports customized endpoints, persistent data handling, and sophisticated analytics, but would require more infrastructure management.

## Final Thoughts

Bugbox AI Tutor Bot is designed with scalability in mind. Its front-end can run on any modern web browser and be deployed to cost-efficient hosting providers, while back-end options offer a clear path to expand functionality as needed.

With an estimated cost of **$0.55 per classroom per hour**, the Tutor Bot is an affordable and scalable tutoring solution capable of supporting both small classes and growing as the user base increases.
